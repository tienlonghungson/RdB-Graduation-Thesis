Symmetric, public-key (asymmetric), and hash-based cryptography are fundamental pillars of modern cryptography. While  symmetric schemes and hash functions are less vulnerable to quantum attacks, the asymmetric schemes based on factoring or solving the discrete logarithm problem, for example: Rivest-Shamir-Adelman (RSA), Elliptic Curve Cryptography, are completely broken by a quantum adversary via Shor's algorithm~\cite{shor1999polynomial}. Currently deployed public key cryptosystems are used to establish a common secret key between two parties. Doing the same jobs, \gls{qkd} enables two parties to produce a shared random secret key known only to them. Moreover, \gls{qkd} is able to guarantee the security of communication links making them immune to quantum computer-based attacks~\cite{gheorghiu2019benchmarking}. 

The first invented \gls{qkd} protocols are BB84~\cite{bennett1984quantum}, and E91~\cite{ekert1992quantum}. Since 2005, \gls{qkd} has been initially implemented in real life. For example, in 2005, University of Geneva and Corning Inc used a fiber optic wire of $307$ km. In 2007, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) used the BB84 protocol over a 148.7 km optical fiber. In 2018, Quantum Xchange launched the first quantum network in the U.S., offering $1,000$ km of fiber optic cable and 19 colocation centers along the Boston-to-Washington, D.C., corridor and metro hubs. However, due to the intrinsic exponential losses over optical fiber, the deployed \gls{qkd} systems' range is restricted to under $1000$ km. So as to establish intercontinental secure communication links, which usually requires a range over $1000$ km, satellite \gls{qkd} has been proposed as an alternative, with the pioneering Micius satellite. In these systems, the transmitter (satellite) and the receiver (optical ground station) relentless exchange information after measuring the quantum states. But transmitting faint quantum optical pulses between a satellite and the Earth is challenging due to high channel losses cause by volatility environment and rapid relative motion between two parties. 

To deal with this problem, the reliable and efficient timing and synchronization systems have been proposed in~\cite{khader2018time,duan2021survey}. In this system, a classical channel is used along with the quantum channel, because of its advantage in synchronization. Figure~\ref{fig:qkd_satellite} shows a high-level view of this schematic.

\end{figure}

Based on that concept, in~\cite{zhang2021timing}, a \gls{dBTS} is introduced using a beacon with on-off model. In this model, a de Bruijn sequence is transmitted from the satellite to the ground for synchronization. 

The encode process happens at the satellite, where it uses the \gls{lfsr} algorithm to generate a positioning sequence (of order $k$ for example). The prerequisite of finding a proper primitive polynomial is the main drawback of this encoder. 

The decode process takes place at the ground station, a look-up table is used to identify the unique position of the received sequences of length $k$. The complexity of this method is exponential.

Furthermore, in this model, a sequence of beacon pulses are used to represent a binary de Bruijn sequence. Considering the timing jitter performance, a long period of no-pulses should be forbidden. If one pulse slot is used to represent a binary bit, for example, on is 1 and off is 0, a long run of 0's in the sequence (which is a long period of no-pulses) would impact the timing jitter. In \cite{zhang2021timing}, two pulse slots are used to represent a single bit, on-on is 1 and on-off is 0, so that one can avoid two consecutive no-pulses. The transmitted sequence is called \gls{HdB}. However, the above scheme requires $2n$ pulse slots to represent a de Bruijn sequence of length $n$ and needs to receive a sub-sequence of $2 \log n$ pulse slots to locate its position. Formally, the \gls{HdB} sequence's rate is just $0.5$, where rate is a quantity that needs to be as high as possible (the definition of sequences' rate is given in section \ref{sec:rate}).
