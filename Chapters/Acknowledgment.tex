First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the subject teachers at Hanoi University of Science and Technology for their continuous guidance throughout my study, especially ones from School of Information and Communication Technology. During the past three and a half years, I have learned from them needed knowledge for pursuing later stages in my Computer Science journey.

I thankfully acknowledge the support of Prof. Huynh Thi Thanh Binh, who accepted me into MSO Lab and guided me in the first steps of my research career. My appreciation also extends to my laboratory colleagues, I'm very happy to have had the opportunity to collaborate with all of you, especially M.Sc. Tran Ba Trung, who introduced and invited me to joint work with him on our very first theoretical topic. I would also like to send my sincerity to other members of MSO Lab, Dr. Nguyen Thi My Binh, M.Sc. Nguyen Hong Ngoc, Tran Cong Dao, Tran Huy Hung and Nguyen Dac Tam. Dr.Binh and M.Sc Ngoc supported me a lot when I first joint our lab. Brothers Dao, Hung, and Tam lent a hand to review my thesis. 

I also cherish the moment of doing my thesis under the supervision of Dr. Tran Vinh Duc. Though time is short, but his style in research inspired me so much. 

Taking my first step in doing theoretical research, I owe a great debt of gratitude to Dr. Ta Duy Hoang (ENS de Lyon) and Dr. Vu Van Khu (National University of Singapore) for training and mentoring me during the working on various problems including ones in this thesis. Without their support (both professionally and personally), it would not have been possible for this work to progress as far as it has. 

I'm also grateful to FPT Young Talent's members, especially Do Hoang Khanh, Lai Ngoc Tan, and Thanh La. I'll always remember the late night we spent together sharing our stories and our plans. I had known the way to find my answer to "Who am I going to be? How do I want to live in the next 10 years? 20 years? \dots?" since that night.

In Bach Khoa Street Workout, my gratitude goes to Xuan Nam, Duc Anh, and Thanh Hai. We've trained and shared our experiences in SW, life and  work as brothers. 

My student's life must be harder without the following idiots: Phan Viet Hoang, Phi Phuc , Khanh Doan, Ng Duc Long, Tran Anh, Ba Tan, and Hong Sang. They are my best friends for the last four years.

I'm also very grateful to my aunt Hang and uncle Lich, who always look after me just like my mom and dad. 

Last but not least, this thesis is dedicated to my parents for the two decades of your love and support. I would not have come this far without your loving weight behind me.
