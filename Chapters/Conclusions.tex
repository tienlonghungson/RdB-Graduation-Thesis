\section{Summary}
This thesis proposes to use the RdB sequences in the \gls{dBTS} system. This is a new kind of sequence having many advantages in synchronization and avoiding the long period of no pulses in quantum communication or satellite channels. Some properties of the sequences have been studied for the first time in this thesis. The first explicit formula of the maximal length of the \gls{RdB} sequence is also provided. Furthermore, this thesis presents a construction of an optimal RLL dBs with sub-linear encoding/decoding algorithms. 

\section{Future works}
In future work, it's critical to analyze more deeper about the RdB sequence under some other constraints like weight constraint or local constraint. The current results right now just focus on alphabet of size $2$. The study of more general alphabet will raise many more questions in combinatorics and algorithm. Especially, results for the alphabet of size $4$ will be valuable in the research of DNA storage as well as DNA sequencing, a very interested field recently.
